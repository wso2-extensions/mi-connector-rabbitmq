# mi-connector-rabbitmq
The RabbitMQ connector enables WSO2 Micro Integrator (MI) to publish messages and perform RPC interactions with a RabbitMQ broker. It supports reliable, asynchronous communication, allowing you to send messages to queues or exchanges, use the RPC pattern, and manage acknowledgments by accepting, discarding, or requeuing messages.
